# Merchant Payout
This help to calculate how much money should be disbursed to each merchant based on the following rules:

* Disbursements are done weekly on Monday.
* We disburse only orders which status is completed.
* The disbursed amount has the following fee per order:
  * 1% fee for amounts smaller than 50 €
  * 0.95% for amounts between 50€ - 300€
  * 0.85% for amounts over 300€

### Task Done
* Create the necessary data structures and a way to persist them for the provided data by following the [provided schema](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wms8dlqzs6bqkul/backend%20challenge%20dataset.zip?dl=0)
* Calculate and persist the disbursements per merchant on a given week. As the calculations can take some time it should be isolated and be able to run independently of a regular web request, for instance by running a background job.
* Create an API endpoint to expose the disbursements for a given merchant on a given week. If no merchant is provided return for all of them.
